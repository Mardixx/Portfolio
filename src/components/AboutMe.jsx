            <span>First of all, thank you for taking the time out of your busy day and taking a look at my portfolio. This means a lot.</span>
            <span>In this Portfolio, you will be able to find 4 of my projects from the training I followed at BeCode Charleroi. 
                These projects are the ones I consider to have learned the most whilst creating them.</span>
